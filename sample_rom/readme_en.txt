Sample MegaROM Program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a sample program to check the operation of the MegaROM I made.
It speaks using PSG. (*Some machines with a PSG-compatible sound source do not produce sound, e.g. MX-101)

VOICEVOX: Nekotsuka Bii was used for the audio.

Please note that you must abide by the terms of Nekotsuka Bii's license agreement regarding the use of audio.

If you want to run it on an emulator, select an ASCII16 type megacomputer.
